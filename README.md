# Heart Disease-Prediction-Web-App
🚀 Heart Disease Prediction Web App - Machine Learning in Healthcare

I've developed an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts heart disease risk based on patient clinical data. This project demonstrates practical AI implementation in healthcare diagnostics.

🔧 Technical Implementation:
✅ Core Framework: Python Flask web application
✅ ML Engine: Scikit-learn model (loaded via model.pkl)
✅ Clinical Parameters Analyzed:

Age, Sex, Cholesterol levels

Resting blood pressure, ECG results

Exercise-induced angina, ST slope

Max heart rate, fasting blood sugar

🖥️ User Flow:

Patients/doctors input 11 clinical parameters via web form

System processes inputs with NumPy/Pandas

Trained model generates prediction (1: At Risk, 0: Normal)

Clear diagnostic result displayed:
🚨 "The Patient Has Heart Disease, please consult the Doctor"
✅ "The Patient Normal"

💻 Code Highlights:

Secure model loading with Python Pickle

Dynamic form handling with Flask request methods

Clean MVC architecture separating logic and presentation

Responsive output rendering with Jinja2 templates

🌐 Deployment Ready:
(The commented code shows capacity for custom deployment:
host='0.0.0.0', port=4566)

🔜 Future Enhancements:

Patient risk probability percentages

Historical data comparison

Doctor login portal for case tracking

Model explainability features

This project showcases my skills in productionizing ML models and creating clinically relevant tools. While not a substitute for medical expertise, it demonstrates how AI can support preliminary diagnostics.
